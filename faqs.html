                    <p>All residents and tourists must wear face masks, wash hands regularly, and practice proper social distancing, especially in public establishments, to help reduce the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 disease.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-question"> When is the best time to go to Batanes?</h1>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The best time to visit Batanes is during the dry or summer season. In the Philippines, the months of March, April, May, and June are considered the hottest months with minimal rainfall. These are also the best months to visit Batanes. Fewer chances of rainfall mean fewer chances of delayed or canceled flights and you’ll be able to enjoy your trip better since Batanes tourist attractions are mostly outdoors. <p>

                <h1 class="faq-question"> What is the Climate and Weather in Batanes?</h1>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Batanes has a tropical climate like the rest of the Philippines. The average yearly temperature is 26.0 °C. April is the driest month, while August is the rainiest month so best to avoid traveling to Batanes during that time. November to February are the coldest and often have rainy days as well. </p>

                <h1 class="faq-question">What to Wear?</h1>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>During the dry summer months, wear comfortable clothes with breathable fabric since you’ll be spending most of the time outdoors. Better bring your sunblock and umbrella to keep you shaded from the sun. If you’re planning a trip in the rainy or cold months, bring an umbrella and raincoat/poncho to keep you dry. You might also want to bring extra clothes for a quick change during your Batanes tours.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-question">How to go to Batanes?</h1>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p style="text-indent: 15px">The best way to go to Batanes is by direct flights or connecting flights to Basco. Depending on where you’re flying from, domestic flights to Basco can take between 70 and 110 minutes. If you’re in Metro Manila, Philippine Airlines (PAL) flies daily from Manila to Basco, Batanes for 1 hour and 45 minutes.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 15px">Try booking weekday flights instead of a weekend one (or long weekends in the Philippines) if you’re on a budget and looking for less expensive plane tickets. Normally, flights during these days are less expensive and one of the most recommended cheapest ways to Batanes.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-question">How to get around Batanes?</h1>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>By jeepney. They journey around the island of Batan from 5:00AM to 5:00PM (you often just need to flag them down at certain areas). If in doubt, feel free to talk to a local.</p>
                    <p>By tricycle. You can arrange this with your hotel, a tour operator, or directly with a tricycle driver. We call them as “Batoda” and apart from taking you to and from near distances, they can also provide day rentals to help you explore the island. To go around the north of Batan, they customarily ask Php 1,000, and for the south, about Php 1,500. (In Sabtang, touring the whole island starts at a cost of Php 800).</p>
                    <p>By motorcycle or bike. You can rent a motorcycle starting at Php 500 a day (it can go up if you want a guide/driver, if you want a bigger motorbike, etc. and if you want per hour, it can be about Php 150 per hour). A simple bike would cost about Php 300 a day (or Php 25 per hour). If in doubt about where to rent, just ask a local and they will direct you to the right place.</p>
                    <p>By car. If you’re coming with a big group, it’s best to do a tour for a hassle-free experience.</p>
                    <p>By boat. To get to the other inhabited islands of Sabtang and Itbayat, you will need to go through an exciting boat ride with our local boats called ‘faluwa’.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-question">What to pack?</h1>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Make sure you are prepared to travel simply. Bring the bare necessities with you. Remember that you’ll be doing a lot of walking and boat rides so pack light. While bottled water is readily available in most convenient stores, be kind to Mother Earth (and your wallet). Bring your own water bottle and just refill from your hotel or homestay. This way, you also don’t have to carry empty water bottles around.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-question">Is there a good internet connection in Batanes?</h1>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Given that Batanes is a far-flung group of islands, the internet connection there is quite limited and slow. Some hotels have it but they will often ask for an extra charge to use it; if you don’t want that, you can buy a Smart or Globe SIM card but they will only have LTE signal strength (alternatively, you can get an eSIM). There are also some computer cafes found in Basco with a decent internet connection, primarily used by the younger ones for gaming — but still, those are worth a shot.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Bring enough cash in Philippine Peso (PHP). There are only 2 ATM in Basco, Batanes and there are no foreign exchange facilities in town. Commercial establishments also do not accept credit card payments, so it’s best to bring cash and be smart with your expenses.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Locals speak Ivatan, but the majority can speak and understand Filipino and English. Learning to speak the native tongue is a great way to befriend locals. Phrases like dius mamahes (thank you), ara ka mangu (how are you?), and avek dana / mangay aku na (goodbye) can go a long way.</p>
