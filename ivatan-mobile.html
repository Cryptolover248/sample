      <h1>Meet the Ivatans</h1>
      <a><div id="bannerImage"><img src="img2.jpg" alt=""/></div></a>
      <p>Why is a place beautiful? Is it the many natural wonders, the culture, or the history? Is it the well-known tourist destinations and landmarks? On top of that, it's the people. Everyone who visits Batanes is always left with the feeling that the Ivatan people are happy, kind, and truthful. They are accurate, yes. However, they are also independent, hardworking, usually reserved, and composed.</p>
      <a><div id="bannerImage"><img src="img3.jpg" alt=""/></div></a>
      <p>About the Ivatans, hardly much is known. We are also left wondering why they are so cool given the limited things we do know about them. Is it the weather, their undulating hills, or their grass headgear? Could their seclusion be what gives them their unique differences?</p>
      <a><div id="bannerImage"><img src="img4.jpg" alt=""/></div></a>  
      <p>Batanes' ascent to fame didn't take long. Compared to other tourism sites in the Philippines, not many people have yet visited its trails. However, the tales of the few tourists who have been here are actually sparking international debate.</p>
      <a><div id="bannerImage"><img src="img5.jpg" alt=""/></div> </a>
      <p>The enthogenesis of the Ivatans is still unclear. According to researchers, they came from Taiwan 4000 years ago. Others assert that they are of northern Luzon Ibanag ancestry. They are Austronesian, and most South East Asians share genetic and linguistic characteristics with them.</p>
      <a><div id="bannerImage"><img src="img6.jpg" alt=""/></div></a>
      <p>The climate and topography of the Ivatan people influence their way of life. But it also helped kids learn independence. In fact, you hardly ever see them lined up for disaster relief food after typhoons. They are admirable in that they do not rush to offer little assistance just because they managed to rescue something.</p>
      <a><div id="bannerImage"><img src="img7.jpg" alt=""/></div></a>
      <p>Ivatan people are renowned for their endearing honesty. In contrast to other regions where it is difficult to locate this human value, the Batanes place it at the center of their culture. Despite how contemporary their lives are now, Batanes still embodies the Bayanihan spirit of the Filipino people. They even have separate terminology for particular cooperative acts: yaru, kapanindongan/kamanidungan, payuhuan, and pitutulungan. This shows how thriving it is.</p>
      <a><div id="bannerImage"><img src="img8.jpg" alt=""/></div></a>
      <p>Do you know any Ivatan people? Have you ever observed how enjoyable it is to converse with them? They normally don't act aggressively. And this place's lack of crime is evidence of their characteristic tranquility. Amazing, isn't that?</p>
